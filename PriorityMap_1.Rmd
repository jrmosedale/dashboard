####Summary  
**What does the map show?**   
The 'nature network' map shows those areas of Cornwall, currently excluded from statutory protection, that are considered the most valuable in terms of their existing biodiversity, habitats, connectivity and  provision of key ecosystem services.
Three prioritization classes can be viewed, which correspond to the most valued 5, 10 and 20% of currently non-protected land.   

**Prioritization methodology**  
Prioritization bands derive from a ranking of *__all__* areas outside of statutory protection. The methodology ranks areas based on their biodiversity value and their provision of ecosystem services, while also accounting for key constraining or facilitating factors that could affect the value of these benefits.       
Rankings are assigned using Zonation methodology (REF), which has been widely used for land use and conservation planning. The methodology allows the relative weighting of different indicators of biodiversity value, ecosystem services and other factors while inherently accounting for the value of habitat connectivity. The approach is shaped around a methodology which allows easy updating/replacement of underlying data layers, adjustments to the perceived importance of different services, and can be applied to different spatial areas and scales.     

**Notes on the use and interpretation of maps**  
It is important to recognize some key aspects of the map and the underlying methodology by which it as generated:

* Rankings are assigned uniquely on the basis of *__current__* indicators of ecosystem services, biodiversity and factors like population or industrial activity that may affect the value of ecosystem services.   
* High prioritization does *__not__* imply that the existing landcover or habitat features are those best able to deliver the greatest biodiversity or ecosystem service benefits. The biodiversity value and provision of ecosystem servics of even highly ranked areas may still often be improved.    
* High prioritization generally favours areas that deliver multiple benefits.   
* Cell rankings are *__not__* fully independent of each other. This dependence is most evident by considering the connectivity of cells. The value of a habitat ‘corridor’ is only meaningful if the two habitats that it links are maintained.    

Valid potential applications include: 

* Identification of additional areas for protection that build upon existing areas under statutory protection.    
* Targetting of strategic resources to maintain biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services.

####Outline of Methodological steps  
  
**1. Define area for prioritization**  
Whole of Cornwall mainland at a resolution of 100m2.  
    
**2.  Define irreplaceable habitats & existing protected areas:**  
These areas define the underlying network of habitats that are taken as ‘given’ and inform habitat area and connectivity benefits: 

* Statutory designated areas: SSSI, SAC, SPA, national and local nature reserves.   

**3. Select biodiversity indicators**  
The relative importance of different habitats and other indicators of biodiversity are selected and weightings applied according to a judgement of their importance and the reliability of the data.

3a.  *Habitat types & features*    

* Landcover classes: a synthesis of several existing sources of landcover was used to define habitat types.   
* Linear features: open watercourses and hedgerows.   
* Habitat condition data: *__no__* suitable data for the whole of mainland Cornwall was available.    
* Habitat Connectivity: is integral to the Zonation methodology.    
 
3b. *Species presence or distributions*  

* Species distribution data: *__not__* used due to concerns that the existing distribution data was not representative of distributions across the whole of mainland Cornwall.     

3b. *Non-statutory designations based on biodiversity value*   

* Country Wildlife Sites.      
  

**4. Ecosystem services**  
Each service is given a weighting to describe the relative importance ascribed to different ecosystem services and the reliability of the underlying data informing their calculation. The following key ecosystem services are estimated:    

* Flood mitigation      
* Carbon storage     
* Pollination     
* Water quality management for aquaculture, drinking water, beaches and for ‘not good’ catchments.      
* Air quality management      

Estimation of these services requires an assessment of the ‘demand for’ or ‘risk’ associated with each service (eg areas susceptible to flooding), as well as of service provision. Areas ‘at risk’ and areas of service provision are often spatially distant.    

**5. Facilitating factors**  
Factors that could facilitate the delivery and/or protection of existing assets and services are given a positive weighting reflecting their relative importance.   

* Indicators of sympathetic land ownership or management such as National Trust land holdings or participation in higher-level environmental stewardship schemes.     
* Unsuitability for alternative land uses such as steep slopes or north facing aspects.     

**6. Constraint factors**
Factors that could constrain the delivery and/or protection of existing assets and services are given a negative weighting according to their relative importance. A high negative weighting will ensure a low ranking is assigned to those areas to which the constraint factor applies.    

* Suitability for alternative land use (opportunity costs):     
    + Agricultural land grade.      
    + Existing / recent planning commitments.     
    + Mineral deposits.     
* Presence of existing land features that reduce benefits/services:     
    + Built-up areas      
    + Recreational greenspaces (golf courses, playing fields…)      
    + Roads / railways / infrastructure       
    + Quarries      

**7. Additional layers for inclusion in visualisation but not analysis**    
Additional information layers are included to provide context for the analysis but do not affect prioritization. Such factors are given a zero weighting in the analysis. Such factors include administrative boundaries and the AONB.

**Note: Integrating ecosystem services dependent upon accessibility**   
The provision of some ecosystem services depends on access / visitation to greenspace including a range of cultural/recreational/health benefits. Accessibility, however, can be detrimental to the value of other services including biodiversity, noise or soil loss mitigation.  
Some simple options to reflect aspects of accessibility include:  

* Weighting according to size of nearby resident population (which will favour protected areas close to population centres).     
* Weighting by presence of access methods such as the density of foopaths or the right of open access to an area. This does not address wider aspects of accessibility like distance from poopulation centres, public or private transport options.    
* Analysis of prioritizations for different administrative units - this will indirectly favour a wider spatial distribution of high priority areas.
