Abstract : The purpose of the 19 community network areas is to:

involve local communities in improving local services; 
identify, agree and then deliver local priorities; 
enable local councillors to have more influence over the delivery of services to the communities they represent; and 
enable communities to make choices about the way in which services are delivered in their areas. 

They have been created from parish and town council areas.
